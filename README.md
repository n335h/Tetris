# Choose your own (React) adventure

- Review and reinforce concepts: Use this time to revisit any concepts from last week or yesterday that you still find confusing. You can complete unfinished workshops, collaborate with your fellow bootcampers, or explore online resources to deepen your understanding.

- Explore React libraries: Take your React learning further by discovering libraries that extend React's capabilities. Use this repo to create a React app with create-react-app and experiment. Some popular options include:

  - Simplify form creation and management: [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) or [Formik](https://formik.org/) can make it easier to create forms and handle form state in your React applications.
  - Enable multi-page routing:[ React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) allows you to manage navigation and route between multiple pages within your React app.
  - Add animations to your components: [Framer](https://www.framer.com/motion/) or [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) offer powerful tools to create engaging animations for your React components.
  - Enhance data fetching: [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) helps you manage asynchronous data fetching, caching, and synchronization with ease.

- Get inspired and start building: Find inspiration from curated project lists like [this one](https://hackr.io/blog/react-projects) or the [React developer roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/react) and start building your own React project in this repo to practice your skills and showcase your creativity.
